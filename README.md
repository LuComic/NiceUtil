# NiceUtil

## The idea

NiceUtil combines the visual aspect of applications like Spaceman, Waybar etc, to show spaces in your menubar, and applications that let you save your Workspaces/Virtual Desktops.

## Usage

1. Have a mac
2. Clone the repo to your computer and use Xcode to build it into an Application.
3. Run the application and go to a clean desktop or stay on the current one.

4. Make sure apps that you want to save are running on the desktop and from the menu click "Save Current Workspace...".

5. Name the space and in the future when you load it, it starts up all of the applications that were saved.
